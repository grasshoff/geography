{"Title":{"0":"Copernicus' Heliograph"},"Shorttitle":{"0":"COPS"},"Abstract":{"0":"<p>In November 1516, Nikolaus Copernikus, was elected as administrator at Olsztyn and had to move there from Frombork\/Frauenburg. He therefore had to interrupt his astronomical work and observations in Frombork. His keen interest in observations of the equinoxes led him to set up a novel type of observatory at the interior hallway at the north side of the castle of Olsztyn. Above the entrance to his private apartments a table with measuring lines was installed.<\/p><p>In the course of the centuries, this panel was repeatedly painted over and partially destroyed. Due to the careful restoration and scientific re-evaluation of the panel in this century, the panel is today in a good state of preservation. On the occasion of the 540th anniversary of Copernicus, the Museum Warmii i Mazur w Olsztynie published an excellent scientific documentation. With the kind permission of the Museum, photos for a 3D-model of the panel could be taken in October 2016. Photos, 3D models and data form this collection for further analysis.<\/p>"},"Description":{"0":"The measured values of the panel form the basis for a 3D reconstruction of the panel, which was calculated using photos taken by Gerd Gra\u00dfhoff and Joanna Pruszynska with kind support of the Museum Warmii in autumn 2016.
