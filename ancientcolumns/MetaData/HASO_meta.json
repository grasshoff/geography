With its 56 metres height and a diameter of 31 metres, the dome is one of the most impressive domes built in ancient times. It was used as a coronation church by Byzantine emperors.<\/p>\n"},"Description":{"0":"The repository contains the complete model of the Bern campaign; only the upper part of the vault could not be measured due to renovation works carried out on the dome at the time of the campaign."},"DefaultThumbExtension":{"0":"png"},"ResourceTypeIconsPath":{"0":"http:\/\/repository.edition-topoi.org\/resource_type_icons\/default\/"},"ServiceImagesPath":{"0":"\/HASO\/ServiceHASO\/Images\/"},"StartpageMainImg":{"0":"HASO.jpg"},"CollectionsBgImg":{"0":"HASO.jpg"},"CollectionImageCopyright":{"0":"None"},"GalleryNumFigPerPage":{"0":"12"},"HierarchyPlaceholder":{"0":"http:\/\/repository.edition-topoi.org\/img\/thumb_placeholder.jpg"},"AdditionalInformationText":{"0":"The work was done in the year 2008."},"FilterSubjects":{"0":"['Architecture', 'Archaeology']"},"FilterResourceTypes":{"0":"['Images', '3D Data']"},"FilterGeolocations":{"0":"['Turkey']"},"FilterPeriods":{"0":"['Antiquity']"},"SpecificAttributes":{"0":"[['Creators', 'Volker Hoffmann'], ['Publisher', 'Edition Topoi'], ['Institutions', 'Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin, Universit\u00e4t Bern, Excellence Cluster 264 Topoi'], ['Subject', '101 Ancient Cultures, 102 History'], ['Subject Scheme', 'DFG']]"},"TechnicalCharacteristics":{"0":"[['pid System', 'DOI']]"},"Annotations":{"0":"[['Entry Date', '2016-12-15'], ['Last Update', '2016-12-15']]"},"GeneralInformation":{"0":"[['Description', 'The repository contains the complete model of the Bern campaign; only the upper part of the vault could not be measured due to renovation works carried out on the dome at the time of the campaign.']]"},"LicenseName":{"0":"Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE"},"LicenseFullname":{"0":""},"LicenseURL":{"0":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/de\/"},"LicenseLogo":{"0":"by-nc-sa.eu.png"},"LicenseAdditionalText":{"0":""},"Keywords":{"0":"['3d scanning', 'architectural geometry']"},"Institutions":{"0":"['Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin', 'Excellence Cluster 264 Topoi', 'Universit\u00e4t Bern']"},"ResearchGroup":{"0":"[['Volker Hoffmann', 'Nikolaos Theocharis']]"},"Links":{"0":"[]"},"UsesSciVersion":{"0":"2"},"DOI":{"0":"10.17171\/2-2"}}
