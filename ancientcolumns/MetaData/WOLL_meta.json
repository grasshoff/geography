{"Title":{"0":"The Textile Revolution"},"Shorttitle":{"0":"WOLL"},"Abstract":{"0":"The research project Textile Revolution integrates studies on the introduction and spreading of the woolly sheep and wool usage from different scientific fields. Past herd structures of domesticates are investigated on the basis of bone finds; spinning tools and textile-related finds provide information on fabric production, and herding-related vegetation disturbances are investigated using pollen data. The investigated area spans from the Zagros mountains in the south-east to the Great Hungarian Plain in the north-west and the time period between 6500 - 1500 BC is covered."},"Description":{"0":"The hyptheses of the project Textile revolutions are that this economic diversification should be visible in bone assemblages from prehistoric sites and that changing techniques of textile production are represented by changing styles of textile tools. The introduction of wool as a raw material for textile production required increased sheep herding. Intensified  pastoral activities lead to increasing land degradation, starting with change and reduction of vegetation cover and soil compaction, leading to reduced landscape resilience and ultimately fostering soil erosion.<br><br>The data collection comprises sets of bone data, textile-related archaeological finds and environmental data:<br><br>Bone data:<br><br>The archaeozoological data retrieved from archaeological bone finds from 402 sites contain summary data for each site (respectively archaeologically defined sub-units), taxon specific data of the sheep (Ovis aries) bones within an assemblage and a large amount of osteometric data of single sheep bones (n = 14.230). Summary data comprise the amount of bones from domestic and wild ungulate animals to show the status of sheep within an assemblage.
