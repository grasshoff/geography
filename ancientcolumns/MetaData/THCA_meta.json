{"Title":{"0":"Chemical composition of early ceramics from Thessaly, Greece"},"Shorttitle":{"0":"THCA"},"Abstract":{"0":"Some 1300 samples of early ceramics from Thessaly were analysed by WD-XRF to distinguish possible local groups and to get information on production and distribution. The analyses covered styles from Early Neolithic (Protosesklo) to Late Neolithic (Classical Dimini and Otzaki) as well as Mycenaean pottery. The analysed sherds mainly represented surface finds from sites in the eastern and western Thessalian plains but also included pottery samples from excavations at Sesklo, Dimini, Soufli Magoula, Platia Magoula Zarko, and Makrychori 2."},"Description":{"0":"<p>Between 1979 and 1992 Neolithic pottery samples from Thessaly were analysed as part of a project 'Fr\u00fche Keramik Thessaliens', with financial support from the German Volkswagenstiftung. The material was sampled in several series. It comprised Neolithic to Mycenaean pottery from sites in the eastern and western Thessalian plains, including e.g. the famous sites Sesklo, Dimini, Achilleion, and Servia. Most sherds are surface finds collected during numerous surveys and stored in the museum in Larissa. They were analysed to determine compositional groups and their possible correlation to find spots. This, however, turned out to be feasible only for stratified coarse pottery which was not exchanged like the painted or slipped fine wares. The bulk of the fine wares had been produced at many, though unidentified, sites. An exception is the technologically very special type of grey-on-grey ceramic for which a provenance from a limited region in the northeast corner of the western plain was probable by comparison with geological clay samples. Stratified material was included from excavations in Soufli Magoula, Platia Magoula Zarko, and Makrychori 2. Only a small part of the data has been published, including pottery of the beginning of the Late Neolithic and of the Mycenaean periods. Analyses of earlier phases and many analyses of Late Neolithic Otzaki and Classical Dimini styles, however, are not published. Analyses of clay used by traditional potters in Thessaly in the early 1980s and geological clay samples collected during various campaigns gave an idea of the geochemical variation of clay from Sesklo and from the eastern and western Thessalian plains.
