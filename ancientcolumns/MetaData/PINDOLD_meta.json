{"Title":{"0":"Rock Paintings in Indonesia"},"Shorttitle":{"0":"PINDV"},"Abstract":{"0":"Rock paintings in Indonesia were recorded during three short excursions by Markus W\u00e4fler and Wolfgang Marschall. Threatened by environmental changes and human interventions and activities, these rock paintings represent the latest specimen of early drawings in that region. Their age determination has not yet been completed, but Australian researchers consider some of them to be the eldest testimonies of figurative drawings of early mankind."},"Description":{"0":"<p>The present data are based on the drawings from the first three volumns published by W\u00e4fler and Marschall. The rock paintings were re-drawn by Markus W\u00e4fler, and have, after their digitization by Thomas Hofmeier, been processed by Gerd Gra\u00dfhoff and Gordon Fischer so that they could be uploaded into the database. \nA fourth volume with individial figures in systematic categorization will be published by Markus W\u00e4fler.  <\/p>\n\n<p>The authors Markus W\u00e4fler and Wolfgang Marschall have opted for an open-access publication to make the data widely available to researchers and the interested public. Markus W\u00e4fler copied the entire scope of individual figures and will present a detailed classification of the illustrated objects. The data interface allows modern, computer-aided methods for analyzing the rock paintings.<\/p>"},"DefaultThumbExtension":{"0":""},"ResourceTypeIconsPath":{"0":"http:\/\/repository.edition-topoi.org\/resource_type_icons\/default\/"},"ServiceImagesPath":{"0":"\/PIND\/ServicePIND\/Images\/"},"StartpageMainImg":{"0":"PIND.JPG"},"CollectionsBgImg":{"0":"PINDstart.JPG"},"CollectionImageCopyright":{"0":"Wolfgang Marschall"},"GalleryNumFigPerPage":{"0":"12"},"HierarchyPlaceholder":{"0":"http:\/\/repository.edition-topoi.org\/img\/thumb_placeholder.jpg"},"AdditionalInformationText":{"0":"<p>Marschall, Wolfgang und Markus W\u00e4fler.
