{"Title":{"0":"The Neolithic in the Nile Delta"},"Shorttitle":{"0":"MRMD"},"Abstract":{"0":"<p>In Egypt the earliest evidence of mixed farming practices are at present found in Merimde Beni Salama on the Western Delta edge ca. 7,000 cal BP (5,000 cal BC) and the Faiyum 6,650 cal BP (4,650 cal BC), some 3,000 years after the beginning of agricultural practices in the Levantine Middle PPNB. The research project <a href='https:\/\/www.topoi.org\/project\/a-2-4\/'> (A-2-4)<\/a> The Neolithic in the Nile Delta focuses on the Neolithic site of Merimde Beni Salama and the region along the Western Delta edge from the modern town of  El-Qata in the south to Khatatbah in the north. This area was first surveyed in 1927\/8 by Hermann Junker and his team as part of the Austrian West Delta Expedition, which led to the finding of the first Neolithic site in the Nile Delta (Merimde Beni Salama), and its subsequent excavations. Since the most recent investigations in the region (in the late 1970s to early 1980s), significant new findings have come to light, notably the discovery of a Neolithic to Late Predynastic sequence (6th millennium to late 4th millennium BC) at the site of Sais (western Delta) and new discoveries along the northern shore of Lake Qarun in the Faiyum. Many more Early and Mid-Holocene sites in the Western Desert, Eastern Desert and Sinai have also been discovered in the last few decades. Research on the material from these sites allows us to think about the dispersal of technology in a new way, and more available data help us investigate the directionality of influence as we consider the production of lithics, ceramics and other examples of material culture.<\/p>\n"},"Description":{"0":"<p><b>Introduction<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The current project has two main sources of data: those from the new fieldwork (begun in 2013, supported by the Fritz Thyssen Stiftung, the American Research Center in Egypt, the National Geographic Society (GEFNE 165-16), Egypt Exploration Society, and Topoi) and a re-examination and recording of data collected by previous investigations, primarily that of Hermann Junker, Hjalmar Larsen and Pehr Lugn in the 1930s. Both sources of data are examined within an inter-disciplinary framework which aims to situate the Neolithic evidence from the western Nile Delta within its wider environmental and social contexts. This examination brings new interpretations as to the lines of communication evident between sites in the western, and wider Delta, as well as between regions as far afield as Libya and the Levant, and helps to  shed light on the reasons for choosing certain settlement locations over others, and the extent to which these choices were determined by the regional environment and changing climate. The re-assessment of the chronology of the Neolithic-Predynastic is also of importance within the longer term research, so that dating of environmental as well as cultural events can be achieved.  <\/p>\n<p><b>Description<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The prime component of the <a href='https:\/\/www.topoi.org\/project\/a-2-4\/'>TOPOI II A-2-4<\/a> project was to re-evaluate archaeological records and finds resulting from earlier investigations within the context of recent and ongoing research across the region. The writing on these objects by the previous excavators has helped to reconnect many objects, not only to their grid square and depth, but even the structure, hearth or grave. Locating published and unpublished documentation and photos was also a major task, and this material is also helping us to better understand the site of Merimde Beni Salama, and allowing the re-contextualisation of the finds with their documentation. In this way museum collections are helping to inform the present archaeological field research and (re)construct the ancient past. During the course of this project several museums were visited to reassess the material collected during the 1920s to 30s.

During this survey, he discovered Merimde Beni Salama, the earliest Neolithic settlement with domestic structures, and excavated there from 1929 until 1939, finding several thousand pottery, lithic, bone and other artefacts. Junker and his team also found settlement and mortuary remains. To keep a horizontal and vertical control of his excavations Junker established a grid 200 x 240 m, with numbers along the X-axis and letters along the Y-axis. Each object or feature was then recorded as so many centimetres below surface. These are the numbers that are found on artefacts and associated documentation\/box and jar labels today. This includes artefacts and organic remains (e.g. R10 -180; grid square R10 at a depth of 1.80m). In addition, several of the objects were given study numbers, as were graves, pits, silos, and houses. Floral and faunal remains were often recorded as being found in a certain hearth, in a particular grid square so many centimetres below the surface. As was usual at this time in Egypt, there was a division of finds, between those chosen to stay in the country, and those that the excavator was permitted to export. The director of the mission then granted a certain amount of objects to each institution or individual that had sponsored the mission. This has led to objects from archaeological sites, Merimde Beni Salama included, being found in museum collections across the world.']]"},"LicenseName":{"0":"Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 3.0 DE"},"LicenseFullname":{"0":""},"LicenseURL":{"0":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/de\/"},"LicenseLogo":{"0":"by-nc-sa.eu.png"},"LicenseAdditionalText":{"0":""},"Keywords":{"0":"['Merimde Beni Salama', 'Neolithic', 'Egypt', 'West Nile Delta', 'Hermann Junker', 'food production', 'lithics', 'pottery', 'bifacial', 'bone tools', 'grinding stones', 'museums']"},"Institutions":{"0":"['Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin', 'Excellence Cluster Topoi EXC 264', 'Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft']"},"ResearchGroup":{"0":"['Topoi A-2-4']"},"Links":{"0":"[['http:\/\/www.varldskulturmuseerna.se\/Documents\/Medelhavet\/Merimde%20_report_high.pdf', 'Initital Examination, Report'], ['http:\/\/samlingar.varldskulturmuseerna.se\/unlocking-neolithic-foods\/', 'Analysis of the organic residues'], ['http:\/\/samlingar.varldskulturmuseerna.se\/forhistoriska-froer-under-luppen\/', 'Examination of plant remains '], ['http:\/\/www.varldskulturmuseerna.se\/en\/medelhavsmuseet\/collections-and-research\/research\/research-service\/', 'Database, Medelhavsmuseet, Stockholm'], ['http:\/\/www.metmuseum.org\/collections\/search-the-collections?ft=Merimda', 'Database, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York'], ['http:\/\/www.mfa.org\/search\/collections?keyword=Merimd', 'Database, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston'], ['http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/museums\/petrie', 'Database, Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London']]"},"UsesSciVersion":{"0":"2"},"DOI":{"0":"10.17171\/2-2"}}
