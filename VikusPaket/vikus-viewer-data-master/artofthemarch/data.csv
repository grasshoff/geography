I want someone who has been in love and been hurt, who respects sex, who has made mistakes and learned from them. I want a Black woman for president.

Our journey started with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels who were the first to apply the methods of science to a revolution working toward communism : total liberation. This method led to the first great wave of communism, the Bolshevik revolution. The Bolshevik revolution was the first proletarian state, under this rule the soviets created a higher standard of living a new proletarian culture. Within the new proletarian culture women were encouraged to step out of their traditional subservient social positions to become full members of the working class; women were able to play equal roles among men as revolutionaries. After WWII the Bolshevik revolution went into decline but the revolutionary science went on to inspire the Maoist revolution, the second great wave of sustained revolution. The Maoist revolution raised literacy rates, doubled life expectancy, and reduced the infant morality rate . A quarter of the world's population was mobilized to create a better world; a quarter of the world's women stood up to say ""We will no longer be property!"" The Maoist revolution created the largest feminist movement of all time. We will find guidance from the feminist of past revolutions such as Jiang Qing, who played a huge role in the Chinese Cultural Revolution, as well as Vilma Espin, Haydee Tamara, and Celia Sanchez Manduley, who all played vital roles in the Cuban revolution. We must find inspiration in the women leaders of our history and follow in their footsteps.

Our journey started with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels who were the first to apply the methods of science to a revolution working towards communism: total liberation. This method led to the first great wave of communism, the Bolshevik revolution. The Bolshevik revolution was the first proletarian state, under this rule the soviets created a higher standard of living and a new proletarian culture. Within the new proletarian culture women were encouraged to step out of their traditional subservient social positions to become full members of the working class; women were able to play equal roles among men as revolutionaries. After WWII the Bolshevik revolution went into decline but the revolutionary science went on to inspire the Maoist revolution, the second great wave of sustained revolution. The Maoist revolution raised literacy rates, doubled life expectancy, and reduced the infant mortality rate. A quarter of the world's population was mobilized to create a better world; a quarter of the world's women stood up to say ""We will no longer be property!"" The Maoist revolution created the largest feminist movement of all time. We will find guidance from the feminists of past revolutions, such as Jiang Qing, who played a huge role in the Chinese Cultural Revolution, as well as Vilma Espin, Haydee Tamara, and Celia Sanchez Mandulety, who all played vital roles in the Cuban revolution. We must find inspiration in the women leaders of our history and follow in their footsteps. We have risen up in the past and we will rise up now against oppression.
